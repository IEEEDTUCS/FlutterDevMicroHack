This project is a part of Flutter tutorial series organized by IEEE DTU for students currently studying in DTU to help them get started with App Development in Flutter.

With the help of this application, we can perform unit conversions related to Length, Mass, Digital Storage, Time, etc.

This project can help a beginner to understand how to develop good looking UIs in Flutter in a very easy way. This project also helps the developers to understand different features of Dart programming and Flutter, and helps them to understand how they can use [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) and the official [Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) to make awesome UIs in Flutter.
